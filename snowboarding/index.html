            <p>My favorite sport in snowboarding. Everyone else in my family skis, exept my dad who skis and snowboards.
            It was my dad who got me into snowboarding, and ever since I started I have really enjoyed it.
            My dad and I try to go snowboarding at least once every 1-2 weeks.
            Brighton ski resort is open for night skiing/snowboarding, so we usually try to go up on Tuesdays or Wednesdays.</p>
