            <p>My favorite sport is snowboarding. Everyone else in my family skis, exept my dad who skis and snowboards.
            It was my dad who got me into snowboarding, and ever since I started I have really enjoyed it.
            My dad and I try to go snowboarding at least once every 1-2 weeks during ski season.
            Brighton ski resort is open for night skiing/snowboarding, so we usually try to go up on Tuesdays or Wednesdays.</p>

            <h4>Timeline:</h4>
            <ul>
               <li>2018- I was in 4th grade when my dad first convinced me to try snowboarding. He taught me and a friend from our neighborhood every Wednesday at Brighton ski resort after school.</li>
               <li>2022- This was my first year not skiing. I had been enjoying snowboarding so much over the past few years that I decided to only get a snowboard for the season, and not skis like I had before.</li>
               <li>2024- Currently I only snowboard, last year my dad bought me a board and snowboard boots instead of renting them for me for the season. This year I have been focusing more on my ability to do
               easy tricks like jumps and terrain park boxes. The first image is of me two weeks ago going off of a jump and Brighton, and the second image is my dad doing a method off of the same jump.</li>
